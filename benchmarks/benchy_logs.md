Benchy Print Quality Log
========================

Unless otherwise specified, layers are 0.2mm high and infill is 20%.

## 1 Simplify3D, 3D Solutech Orange 1.75mm ABS

## 2 Simplify3D, 3D Solutech White 1.75mm PLA

## 3 Simplify3D, AmazonBasics Black 1.75mm PETG

## 4 Slic3r, Hatchbox 2.85mm PLA

Noted issue with hull--ridge across sides and
front, starting at about 9mm, even with the bottom of the gunwale at
the back of the boat.

## 5

Slic3r, Hatchbox PLA reprint with same settings. Same hull issue.

## 6

Slic3r, PolyLite PLA, looking for hull issue--which is still present.

## 7

Simplify3D, PolyLite PLA, looking for hull issue.

## 8

Cura, PolyLite PLA, looking for issues with the hull.

## 9

First print with 0.3mm nozzle. 0.2mm layer height, 0.2mm first layer.
Material: IC3D white ABS. Noticed corners had little raised parts
during printing, as if there was too much plastic. S3D troubleshooting
guide indicates it may be model is too hot, so changed layers under
30s to run fans up to 50% to increase cooling.

## 10

Switching to 3D Solutech orange ABS. Added fan for quick layers per
note on #9. No too-much-plastic problem, even before the upper layers
where the fans would kick in. Looks like it's an issue with IC3D ABS
